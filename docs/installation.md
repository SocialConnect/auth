## System requirements

Before We start, you should known related requirements for your environment:

- PHP 7.1 or above.
- PHP Sessions (or use stateless mode for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect)
- Curl extension (or you can use stream adapter)
- JSON extension

## Installation

The recommended way to install `socialconnect/auth` is via Composer.

1. If you do not have composer installed, download the [`composer.phar`](https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar) executable or use the installer.

```sh
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

2. Run `php composer.phar require socialconnect/auth` or add a new requirement in your composer.json.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "socialconnect/auth": "^3.0"
  }
}
```

## Getting started

## Choosing HTTP Client
 
After installation `socialconnect/auth`, you should decided what HTTP-client you will use, the main requirement that HTTP-client
should be compatibility with PSR-18.

### Using socialconnect/http-client (recommended)

We had `socialconnect/http-client` package, it's our implementation of PSR-18 (HTTP-Client) based on top of `guzzle/psr-7` library.

Run `composer require socialconnect/http-client`

```php
// You can use any HTTP client with PSR-18 compatibility
$httpClient = new \SocialConnect\HttpClient\Curl();
```

#### HttpClient and caching (useful for OpenID & OpenIDConnect)

Why do we need cache decorator for HTTP Client?

Providers like OpenID & OpenIDConnect require US to request OpenID specification (and JWK(s) for OpenIDConnect).

It's not a best practice to request it every time, because it's unneeded round trip to the server, 
if you are using OpenID or OpenIDConnect we suggest you to use cache.
 
```php
$httpClient = new \SocialConnect\Common\Http\Client\Cache(
    $httpClient,
    /**
     * You can use any library with PSR-16 (simple-cache) compatibility
     */
    new \Symfony\Component\Cache\Psr16Cache(
        new \Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\PhpFilesAdapter(
            'socialconnect',
            0,
            __DIR__ . '/cache'
        )
    )
);

$httpStack = new \SocialConnect\Provider\HttpStack(
    $httpClient,
    new \SocialConnect\HttpClient\RequestFactory(),
    new \SocialConnect\HttpClient\StreamFactory()
);
```

### Using zelenin/http-client

1. `composer require zelenin/http-client:^4.0`

```php
$httpClient = (new \Zelenin\HttpClient\ClientFactory())->create();

$httpStack = new \SocialConnect\Provider\HttpStack(
    $httpClient,
    new \Zend\Diactoros\RequestFactory(),
    new \Zend\Diactoros\StreamFactory()
);
```

### Using guzzle

1. `composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle`
2. `composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter`

```php
$httpClient = new \Http\Adapter\Guzzle6\Client(
    new \GuzzleHttp\Client()
);

$httpStack = new \SocialConnect\Provider\HttpStack(
    $httpClient,
    // @todo Where is factories?
    new \SocialConnect\HttpClient\RequestFactory(),
    new \SocialConnect\HttpClient\StreamFactory()
);
```

## Configure AuthService

```php
$configureProviders = [
    'redirectUri' => 'http://sconnect.local/auth/cb/${provider}/',
    'provider' => [
        'facebook' => [
            'applicationId' => '',
            'applicationSecret' => '',
            'scope' => ['email'],
            'options' => [
                'identity.fields' => [
                    'email',
                    'picture.width(99999)'
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
];

$service = new \SocialConnect\Auth\Service(
    $httpStack,
    new \SocialConnect\Provider\Session\Session(),
    $configureProviders,
    $collectionFactory
);

/**
 * By default collection factory is null, in this case Auth\Service will create 
 * a new instance of \SocialConnect\Auth\CollectionFactory
 * you can use custom or register another providers by CollectionFactory instance
 */
$collectionFactory = null;

$service = new \SocialConnect\Auth\Service(
    $httpClient,
    new \SocialConnect\Provider\Session\Session(),
    $configureProviders,
    $collectionFactory
);
```

## Write code in you Controller

Next create you loginAction:

```php
$providerName = 'facebook';

$provider = $service->getProvider($providerName);
header('Location: ' . $provider->makeAuthUrl());
```

And implement callback handler:

```php
$providerName = 'facebook';

$provider = $service->getProvider($providerName);
$accessToken = $provider->getAccessTokenByRequestParameters($_GET);
var_dump($accessToken);

$user = $provider->getIdentity($accessToken);
var_dump($user);
```
